# Data-Science-Portfolio
This portfolio contains a high-level overview of my personal Data Science/Machine Learning projects.

# [Data Collection and Analysis: Project Overview](https://github.com/dabykov/Projects/tree/main/project-1)
For this project, I scraped a Wikipedia page in order to build a dataset that contains general information regarding major old Hollywood figures. The objective of the project is to showcase the skills related to data collection, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering.

# [Airbnb Price Prediciton Model: Project Overview](https://github.com/dabykov/Projects/tree/main/project-2)
For this project, I built a predictive regression model that estimates Airbnb prices in New York City. The objective of the project is to showcase the skills related to data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis and multiple regression model building and tuning.

# [Bank Customer Churn Prediction Model: Project Overview](https://github.com/dabykov/Projects/tree/main/project-3)
For this project, I built a predictive classification model that estimates whether a certain bank customer is likely to churn. The objective of the project is to showcase the skills related to data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering and classification model building and tuning.
