# [Project 1: Data Collection and Analysis](https://github.com/dabykov/Projects/tree/main/project-1)
The goal of this project was to build a dataset that contains general information about major old Hollywood figures. In order to do it, I implemented several steps:
<ul>
<li> Scraped Wikipedia webpages of 196 figures using BeautifulSoup library </li>
<li> Transformed and cleaned the data for it to be usable for exploratory analysis using such libraries as Pandas, Numpy, and Regex </li>
<li> Engineered features and augmented data</li>
<li> Performed exploratory data analysis and visualized the results in order to gain interesting insights using Matplotlib library.</li> </ul>
Here are some highlights from EDA:

# [Project 2: New York Airbnb Price Prediciton Model](https://github.com/dabykov/Projects/tree/main/project-2)
For this project, I built a predictive regression model that estimates Airbnb prices in New York City. The objective of the project is to showcase the skills related to data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis and multiple regression model building and tuning.


# [Project 3: Bank Customer Churn Prediction Model](https://github.com/dabykov/Projects/tree/main/project-3)
For this project, I built a predictive classification model that estimates whether a certain bank customer is likely to churn. The objective of the project is to showcase the skills related to data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering and classification model building and tuning.
