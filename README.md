# Data Science Portfolio
This portfolio contains a high-level overview of my personal Data Science/Machine Learning projects.

# [Data Collection and Analysis: Project Overview](https://github.com/dabykov/Projects/tree/main/project-1)
The goal of the project is to build and analyze a dataset that contains general information regarding major old Hollywood figures. The data is collected from Wikipeia website. Here are the key highlights of the project:

* Performed web scraping and extracted general information on 196 major figures using BeautifulSoup library.
* Cleaned and transformed the data for it to be usable for exploratory analysis using Pandas, Numpy, and Regex libraries. 
* Performed exploratory data analysis on 14 different features in order to gain some insights into the dataset.

# [Airbnb Price Prediciton Model: Project Overview](https://github.com/dabykov/Projects/tree/main/project-2)
For this project, I built a predictive regression model that estimates Airbnb prices in New York City. The objective of the project is to showcase the skills related to data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis and multiple regression model building and tuning.




# [Bank Customer Churn Prediction Model: Project Overview](https://github.com/dabykov/Projects/tree/main/project-3)
For this project, I built a predictive classification model that estimates whether a certain bank customer is likely to churn. The objective of the project is to showcase the skills related to data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering and classification model building and tuning.
