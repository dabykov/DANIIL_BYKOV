# [Data Collection and Analysis: Project Overview](https://github.com/dabykov/Projects/tree/main/project-1)
The goal of this project was to build a dataset that contains general information about major old Hollywood figures. In order to do it, I implemented several steps:
<ul>
<li> Scraped Wikipedia webpages of 196 figures using BeautifulSoup library </li>
<li> Transformed and cleaned the data for it to be usable for exploratory analysis using such libraries as Pandas, Numpy, and Regex </li>
<li> Engineered features and augmented data</li>
<li> Performed exploratory data analysis and visualized the results in order to gain interesting insights using Matplotlib library.</li> </ul>
Here are some highlights from EDA:
